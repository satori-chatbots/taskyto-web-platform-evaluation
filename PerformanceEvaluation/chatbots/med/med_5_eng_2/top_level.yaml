    Welcome to our hotel reservation center! I can help you with frequently asked questions, check room availability, and manage your reservations. 
    Please note that human support is available from 9 am to 9 pm, but I'm here to assist you 24/7.
  fallback: I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Could you please rephrase?
