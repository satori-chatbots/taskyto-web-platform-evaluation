Taskyto is a powerful framework designed for creating chatbots using a structured YAML syntax. It allows developers to define various modules that dictate the chatbot's behavior, such as menus, actions, data gathering, question answering, and sequences. Each module can be nested and can reference other modules, enabling complex conversation flows.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key components of Taskyto:

Menu Module: This is the top-level module that defines conversation alternatives. It can capture user responses, direct the flow to other modules, or provide fallback responses when the chatbot doesn't understand the input.

Action Module: This module executes specific actions based on user input. It can run Python code and return responses that can be displayed to the user.

Data Gathering Module: This module is used to collect information from users. It can also execute actions based on the gathered data.

Question Answering Module: This module allows the chatbot to respond to predefined questions without needing extensive training phrases.

Sequence Module: This defines a series of steps in a conversation, linking multiple modules together.

The YAML syntax is crucial for defining these modules, and it includes specific rules for how to structure the data, including types, required fields, and response formatting.
