Taskyto is a powerful framework designed for creating chatbots that can engage in natural conversations with users. It utilizes a YAML-based syntax to define various modules that dictate the chatbot's behavior, including menus, actions, data gathering, question answering, and sequences. Each module serves a specific purpose and can be nested or referenced to create complex conversational flows.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key components of Taskyto:

Menu Module: This is the top-level module that defines conversation alternatives. It can capture user responses, handle complex flows, or reference other modules.

Action Module: Executes specific actions based on user input. It can run Python code and return responses based on the results of that code.

Data Gathering Module: Requests information from the user and may execute actions based on the gathered data.

Question Answering Module: Contains predefined questions and answers, allowing the chatbot to respond accurately without needing extensive training phrases.

Sequence Module: Defines a series of steps in a conversation, allowing for more structured interactions.

The framework emphasizes clarity and structure, making it easier to develop chatbots that can handle a variety of tasks and provide accurate responses. If you have any specific questions about Taskyto or need assistance with creating a chatbot, feel free to ask!
