Taskyto is a framework designed for creating chatbots using a structured YAML syntax. It allows developers to define various modules that dictate the chatbot's behavior, including menus, actions, data gathering, question answering, and sequences. Each module serves a specific purpose and can be nested or referenced to create complex conversational flows.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key components of Taskyto:

Menu Module: This is the top-level module that presents users with options. It can include various items like answers, references to other modules, or sequences.

Action Module: This module executes specific actions based on user input. It can run Python code and return responses.

Data Gathering Module: This module collects information from users, which can then be used in subsequent actions.

Question Answering Module: This module allows the chatbot to respond to specific questions without needing extensive training phrases.

Sequence Module: This defines a series of steps in a conversation, allowing for more complex interactions.

The YAML syntax is crucial for defining these modules, and it includes specific rules for how to structure the data, such as declaring data types and ensuring that action modules follow data gathering modules.
