Taskyto is a powerful framework designed for creating chatbots using YAML syntax. It allows developers to define various modules that dictate the chatbot's behavior, including menus, actions, data gathering, question answering, and sequences. Each module serves a specific purpose and can be nested or referenced to create complex conversational flows.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the main components of Taskyto:

Menu Module: This is the top-level module that presents users with options. It can include various items like answers, references to other modules, or sequences.

Action Module: This module executes specific actions based on user input. It can run Python code and return responses.

Data Gathering Module: This module collects information from users, which can then be used in subsequent actions.

Question Answering Module: This module allows the chatbot to respond to specific questions without needing extensive training phrases.

Sequence Module: This defines a series of steps in a conversation, allowing for more complex interactions.

Taskyto uses a clear YAML syntax, making it easy to define the structure and behavior of chatbots. Each module can include fields like name, kind, presentation, data, and response, among others, to specify how the chatbot should behave.
