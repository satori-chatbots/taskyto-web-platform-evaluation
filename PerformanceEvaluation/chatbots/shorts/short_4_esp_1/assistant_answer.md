Taskyto is a powerful framework designed for creating chatbots using YAML syntax. It allows developers to define various modules that dictate the chatbot's behavior, including menus, actions, data gathering, question answering, and sequences. Each module can be nested and can call other modules, enabling complex conversation flows.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key components of Taskyto:

1. **Menu Module**: This is the top-level module that defines conversation alternatives. It can capture user responses or direct the flow to other modules.

2. **Action Module**: Executes specific actions based on user input. It can run Python code and return responses.

3. **Data Gathering Module**: Requests information from the user, which can then be used in subsequent actions.

4. **Question Answering Module**: Provides predefined answers to specific questions without needing extensive training phrases.

5. **Sequence Module**: Chains multiple conversation steps together, allowing for a more structured interaction.

The syntax is designed to be clear and concise, making it easier for developers to create and manage their chatbots. If you have any specific questions about Taskyto or need help with a particular aspect of your chatbot, feel free to ask!
