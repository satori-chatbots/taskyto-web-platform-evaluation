A comprehensive overview of the different types of modules in Taskyto is essential for designing an effective chatbot. Below, I will detail each module type, its primary purpose, distinctive characteristics, and how they interconnect, especially focusing on the dependencies between action modules and data gathering modules, as well as the role of sequence modules in orchestrating complex flows.

1. Menu Module
Purpose: The menu module serves as the primary entry point for user interactions. It presents users with a set of options to choose from.
Characteristics:
Contains items that can be answers, references to other modules, or sequences.
Can specify a fallback response to handle unrecognized inputs.
Allows for exclusive choices among items, guiding the user through the conversation flow.
2. Action Module
Purpose: Executes specific actions based on user input or gathered data.
Characteristics:
Requires data to be gathered beforehand through a data gathering module.
Can perform computations or trigger external scripts.
Returns a result that can be referenced in the response text.
Typically used in sequence modules after data gathering modules.
3. Data Gathering Module
Purpose: Collects necessary information from the user to proceed with actions.
Characteristics:
Defines the data fields required from the user.
Can execute actions upon successful data collection.
Ensures that all required data is gathered before moving to the next step.
The gathered data can be referenced in subsequent actions or responses.
4. Question Answering Module
Purpose: Provides predefined answers to specific questions users may ask.
Characteristics:
Uses an LLM to match user questions to predefined answers without needing multiple training phrases.
Can execute code to modify the answer dynamically based on the context.
The response can be rephrased using LLMs for more natural interactions.
5. Sequence Module
Purpose: Orchestrates a series of steps in a conversation flow.
Characteristics:
Contains references to other modules, including data gathering and action modules.
Must include the memory: full option to enhance context retention.
Allows for complex interactions by chaining multiple modules together, ensuring a logical flow of conversation.
Interconnections and Dependencies
Action and Data Gathering Modules: Action modules depend on data gathering modules to function correctly. An action module cannot operate without first collecting the necessary data through a preceding data gathering module.
Sequence Modules: These modules play a crucial role in managing complex flows by linking multiple modules together. They can include both data gathering and action modules, ensuring that the necessary data is collected before any actions are executed.
Fallback Functionality: Menu modules can specify fallback responses to guide users when their input is not recognized, enhancing user experience.
LLM Utilization: The question answering modules leverage LLMs for matching user queries to answers, allowing for a more dynamic and responsive interaction.
Conclusion
When designing your chatbot, consider the following:

Use menu modules as entry points for user interactions.
Implement data gathering modules to collect necessary information before executing actions.
Utilize action modules to perform tasks based on the gathered data.
Employ sequence modules to create complex flows that guide users through multiple steps.
Leverage question answering modules for providing quick responses to common inquiries.
This structured approach will ensure a logical and efficient design for your Taskyto chatbot.
