Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the different types of modules in Taskyto, their purposes, distinctive characteristics, and how they interconnect. This should help you decide which module to use in each phase of your chatbot design.

1. Menu Module
Purpose: The menu module serves as the entry point for user interactions. It presents users with a set of options to choose from, guiding them through the conversation.

Distinctive Characteristics:

Presentation: It includes a clear description of the module's purpose and expected user interactions.
Fallback: A fallback message can be specified, which is used when the chatbot does not understand the user's input.
Items: It can contain various items, such as answers, references to other modules (like data gathering or question answering), and sequences.
Interconnection: Menu modules can reference other modules, allowing for a structured flow of conversation. They can also lead to sequences that orchestrate multiple steps.

2. Action Module
Purpose: Action modules execute specific actions based on user input or gathered data. They are typically used to perform calculations, send messages, or trigger external processes.

Distinctive Characteristics:

Data Dependency: Action modules assume that the necessary data has been gathered by preceding data gathering modules.
Execution: They can execute Python code, which can be embedded or referenced from an external script.
Interconnection: Action modules are often used in sequence modules, where they follow data gathering modules to perform actions based on the collected data.

3. Data Gathering Module
Purpose: Data gathering modules are designed to collect specific information from users. They prompt users for input and can also perform actions with that data.

Distinctive Characteristics:

Data Definition: They define the data fields that need to be collected, including types and whether they are required.
On-Success Handling: They specify what happens after successful data collection, often leading to an action module.
Interconnection: Data gathering modules are essential for providing the necessary data for action modules. They ensure that the chatbot has the required information to proceed with actions.

4. Question Answering Module
Purpose: This module is used to handle specific questions from users and provide predefined answers. It leverages LLMs (Large Language Models) for matching user queries to the appropriate answers.

Distinctive Characteristics:

Questions and Answers: It contains a list of questions and their corresponding answers.
LLM Matching: The module can utilize LLMs to identify the user's question and provide the correct answer without needing multiple training phrases.
Interconnection: Question answering modules can be referenced in menu modules, allowing users to access information easily. They can also be part of a sequence if further actions are needed based on the answers.

5. Sequence Module
Purpose: Sequence modules orchestrate a series of conversation steps, allowing for complex flows that involve multiple modules.

Distinctive Characteristics:

Memory Management: They require the memory: full option to ensure that the context is maintained throughout the sequence.
References: They can reference multiple modules, including data gathering and action modules.
Interconnection: Sequence modules are crucial for creating multi-step interactions. They can include data gathering modules to collect information and action modules to execute tasks based on that information.

Conclusion
In summary, the choice of module depends on the specific phase of your chatbot design:

Use Menu modules for guiding users and presenting options.
Use Data Gathering modules to collect necessary information.
Use Action modules to perform tasks based on the gathered data.
Use Question Answering modules for providing information in response to user queries.
Use Sequence modules to manage complex flows that involve multiple steps and modules.
This structured approach will help ensure a logical and efficient design for your Taskyto chatbot. If you need assistance in creating specific modules or YAML content, feel free to ask!
