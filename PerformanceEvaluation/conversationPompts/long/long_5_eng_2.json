[{"type": "human", "data": {"content": "Design a chatbot for a hotel reservation center. The bot should be able to answer frequently asked questions and manage reservations. It is only staffed with human personnel between 9 am and 9 pm, but the chatbot can operate 24 hours. If the user wants to book, first ask for the check-in and check-out date, and then the type of room: standard ($80/night), double ($120/night), suite ($200/night). You can book several rooms of the same type (maximum 3 per type). You should also be able to check availability. The chatbot will automatically calculate the total according to the nights and rooms. Everything should flow, although the order of questions may vary if it is more natural. It is not necessary for the user to say everything at once. The focus is on making the experience simple and complete. Also add a faq feature.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "human", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false}}, {"type": "ai", "data": {"content": "Here is the complete Taskyto YAML content for a hotel reservation chatbot, which includes a top-level menu, a FAQ module, data gathering for reservations, and action modules for calculating prices and checking availability.\n\n```yaml\n# -----> File: top_level.yaml <-----\nmodules:\n- name: top-level\n  kind: menu\n  presentation: |\n    Welcome to the Hotel Reservation Center!
