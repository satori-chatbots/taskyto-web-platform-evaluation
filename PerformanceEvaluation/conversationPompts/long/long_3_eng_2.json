This should help you decide which module to use in each phase of your chatbot design.\n\n### 1. Menu Module\n**Purpose:** The menu module serves as the entry point for user interactions. It presents users with a set of options to choose from, guiding them through the conversation.\n\n**Distinctive Characteristics:**\n- **Presentation:** It includes a clear description of the module's purpose and expected user interactions.\n- **Fallback:** A fallback message can be specified, which is used when the chatbot does not understand the user's input.\n- **Items:** It can contain various items, such as answers, references to other modules (like data gathering or question answering), and sequences.\n\n**Interconnection:** Menu modules can reference other modules, allowing for a structured flow of conversation. They can also lead to sequences that orchestrate multiple steps.\n\n### 2. Action Module\n**Purpose:** Action modules execute specific actions based on user input or gathered data. They are typically used to perform calculations, send messages, or trigger external processes.\n\n**Distinctive Characteristics:**\n- **Data Dependency:** Action modules assume that the necessary data has been gathered by preceding data gathering modules.\n- **Execution:** They can execute Python code, which can be embedded or referenced from an external script.\n\n**Interconnection:** Action modules are often used in sequence modules, where they follow data gathering modules to perform actions based on the collected data.\n\n### 3. Data Gathering Module\n**Purpose:** Data gathering modules are designed to collect specific information from users. They prompt users for input and can also perform actions with that data.\n\n**Distinctive Characteristics:**\n- **Data Definition:** They define the data fields that need to be collected, including types and whether they are required.\n- **On-Success Handling:** They specify what happens after successful data collection, often leading to an action module.\n\n**Interconnection:** Data gathering modules are essential for providing the necessary data for action modules. They ensure that the chatbot has the required information to proceed with actions.\n\n### 4. Question Answering Module\n**Purpose:** This module is used to handle specific questions from users and provide predefined answers. It leverages LLMs (Large Language Models) for matching user queries to the appropriate answers.\n\n**Distinctive Characteristics:**\n- **Questions and Answers:** It contains a list of questions and their corresponding answers.\n- **LLM Matching:** The module can utilize LLMs to identify the user's question and provide the correct answer without needing multiple training phrases.\n\n**Interconnection:** Question answering modules can be referenced in menu modules, allowing users to access information easily. They can also be part of a sequence if further actions are needed based on the answers.\n\n### 5. Sequence Module\n**Purpose:** Sequence modules orchestrate a series of conversation steps, allowing for complex flows that involve multiple modules.\n\n**Distinctive Characteristics:**\n- **Memory Management:** They require the `memory: full` option to ensure that the context is maintained throughout the sequence.\n- **References:** They can reference multiple modules, including data gathering and action modules.\n\n**Interconnection:** Sequence modules are crucial for creating multi-step interactions. They can include data gathering modules to collect information and action modules to execute tasks based on that information.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, the choice of module depends on the specific phase of your chatbot design:\n- Use **Menu modules** for guiding users and presenting options.\n- Use **Data Gathering modules** to collect necessary information.\n- Use **Action modules** to perform tasks based on the gathered data.\n- Use **Question Answering modules** for providing information in response to user queries.\n- Use **Sequence modules** to manage complex flows that involve multiple steps and modules.\n\nThis structured approach will help ensure a logical and efficient design for your Taskyto chatbot.
