The bot should answer frequently asked questions, check availability, and manage reservations. To book, it will ask for the check-in/check-out date and room type (standard $80, double $120, suite $200). Up to 3 rooms per type are allowed. It will calculate the total automatically. The flow should be flexible and natural, without forcing the user to book if they only have questions. The experience should be simple and complete.",
