Menu Module\n- **Purpose**: The menu module serves as the primary entry point for user interactions. It presents users with a set of options to choose from, guiding them through the conversation flow.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Contains items that can be answers, references to other modules, or sequences.\n  - Can include a `fallback` response, which is triggered when the chatbot does not understand the user's input.\n  - Supports memory management with the `memory: full` option to enhance context retention.\n- **Use Case**: Use a menu module as the top-level module to organize the conversation and provide clear options for users.\n\n### 2. Action Module\n- **Purpose**: The action module executes specific actions based on user input and previously gathered data.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Does not have a description field.\n  - Assumes that data has been gathered from preceding data gathering modules.\n  - Can return results that can be referenced in the response text.\n- **Interconnection**: Action modules must be preceded by data gathering modules to ensure they have the necessary data to operate.\n- **Use Case**: Use action modules when you need to perform operations or calculations based on user input.\n\n### 3. Data Gathering Module\n- **Purpose**: This module is designed to collect specific information from users, such as names, dates, or preferences.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Contains a `data` section where keywords are defined, specifying the type of data to be collected.\n  - Can include a `description` field to explain what data is being gathered and why.\n  - Supports `on-success` actions to respond to users after data collection.\n- **Interconnection**: Data gathering modules are essential for collecting input before executing action modules.\n- **Use Case**: Use data gathering modules when you need to prompt users for information that will be used later in the conversation.\n\n### 4. Question Answering Module\n- **Purpose**: This module allows the chatbot to respond to specific questions from users without needing extensive training phrases.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Contains a list of predefined questions and their corresponding answers.\n  - Can utilize LLMs (Large Language Models) to identify user questions and provide relevant answers.\n  - Supports an `on-success` section for executing code and returning results.\n- **Interconnection**: The `execute` field can be used to run Python code, allowing for dynamic responses based on user queries.\n- **Use Case**: Use question answering modules when you want to provide quick, factual responses to common inquiries.\n\n### 5. Sequence Module\n- **Purpose**: The sequence module defines a series of steps in a conversation, allowing for complex flows.\n- **Characteristics**:\n  - Must include `memory: full` to enhance context retention across the sequence.\n  - Can reference multiple modules, including data gathering and action modules.\n- **Interconnection**: Sequence modules can link various modules together, creating a coherent flow of conversation.\n- **Use Case**: Use sequence modules when you need to guide users through a multi-step process, such as placing an order or completing a form.\n\n### Comparison and Recommendations\n- **Menu Modules** are best for starting points and guiding users through options.\n- **Data Gathering Modules** are essential for collecting user input before any actions can be taken.\n- **Action Modules** should follow data gathering modules to perform operations based on the collected data.\n- **Question Answering Modules** are ideal for providing quick responses to common questions without extensive training.\n- **Sequence Modules** are useful for creating complex flows that require multiple steps and interactions.\n\nBy understanding these modules and their interconnections, you can optimize the structure and logic of your Taskyto chatbot, ensuring a smooth and effective user experience.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": null}}]
