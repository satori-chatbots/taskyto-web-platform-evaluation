It can capture answers, handle complex conversation flows, or reference other modules. It may also include a fallback response for unrecognized user messages.\n\n2. **Action Module**: This module executes an action based on input data. Actions are defined in Python and produce a response for the user. The response can be displayed verbatim or rephrased using an LLM.\n\n3. **Data Gathering Module**: This module requests data from the user and may execute an action based on the gathered data.\n\n4. **Question Answering Module**: This module declares a set of questions and their answers. It uses an LLM to identify which question corresponds to the user's utterance without needing multiple training phrases.\n\n5. **Sequence Module**: This module defines a chain of conversation steps, each defined in another module. It allows for more complex conversation flows.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need assistance with creating a Taskyto chatbot, feel free to ask!", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": null}}]
