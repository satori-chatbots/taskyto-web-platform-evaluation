Below is the complete YAML content for the chatbot.\n\n### Top-Level Menu\n```yaml\n# -----> File: top_level.yaml <-----\nmodules:\n- name: top-level\n  kind: menu\n  presentation: |\n    Welcome to the Hotel Reservation Chatbot! I can help you book a hotel room. \n    Please let me know what you need assistance with.\n  fallback: I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Could you please rephrase?\n\n  items:\n  - title: Make a Reservation\n    memory: full\n    kind: module\n    reference: reservation_module\n  - title: Frequently Asked Questions\n    kind: module\n    reference: faq_module\n  - title: Welcome Message\n    kind: answer\n    answer: |\n      Hello!
