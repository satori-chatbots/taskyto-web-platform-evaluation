Taskyto allows developers to define chatbot behavior using YAML files, which consist of various modules that dictate how the chatbot interacts with users. The main types of modules include:\n\n1. **Menu Module**: This is the top-level module that defines conversation alternatives. It can capture user responses, manage complex conversation flows, or reference other modules.\n\n2. **Action Module**: This module executes specific actions based on user input. It can run Python code and return responses to the user.\n\n3. **Data Gathering Module**: This module collects information from users, which can then be used in subsequent actions.\n\n4. **Question Answering Module**: This module allows the chatbot to respond to specific questions with predefined answers.\n\n5. **Sequence Module**: This module defines a series of steps in a conversation, allowing for more complex interactions.\n\nEach module can be nested and can call other modules, enabling the creation of sophisticated conversational flows. Taskyto uses a YAML syntax that is both human-readable and easy to manage, making it accessible for developers.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need assistance with creating a Taskyto chatbot, feel free to ask!", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": null}}]
