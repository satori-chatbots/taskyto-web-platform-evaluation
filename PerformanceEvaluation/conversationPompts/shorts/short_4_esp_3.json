It allows developers to define various modules that dictate the chatbot's behavior, including menus, actions, data gathering, question answering, and sequences. Each module serves a specific purpose and can be nested or referenced to create complex conversational flows.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief overview of the main components of Taskyto:\n\n1. **Menu Module**: This is the top-level module that presents users with options. It can include various items like answers, references to other modules, or sequences.\n\n2. **Action Module**: This module executes specific actions based on user input. It can run Python code and return responses.\n\n3. **Data Gathering Module**: This module collects information from users, which can then be used in subsequent actions.\n\n4. **Question Answering Module**: This module allows the chatbot to respond to specific questions without needing extensive training phrases.\n\n5. **Sequence Module**: This defines a series of steps in a conversation, allowing for more complex interactions.\n\nTaskyto uses a clear YAML syntax, making it easy to define the structure and behavior of chatbots. Each module can include fields like `name`, `kind`, `presentation`, `data`, and `response`, among others, to specify how the chatbot should behave.\n\nIf you're looking to develop a Taskyto chatbot, I can assist you in generating the necessary YAML content or answering any specific questions you might have about the framework.
