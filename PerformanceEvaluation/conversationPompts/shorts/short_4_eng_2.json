It utilizes a YAML-based syntax to define various modules that dictate the chatbot's behavior, including menus, actions, data gathering, question answering, and sequences. Each module serves a specific purpose and can be nested or referenced to create complex conversational flows.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief overview of the key components of Taskyto:\n\n1. **Menu Module**: This is the top-level module that defines conversation alternatives. It can capture user responses, handle complex flows, or reference other modules.\n\n2. **Action Module**: Executes specific actions based on user input. It can run Python code and return responses based on the results of that code.\n\n3. **Data Gathering Module**: Requests information from the user and may execute actions based on the gathered data.\n\n4. **Question Answering Module**: Contains predefined questions and answers, allowing the chatbot to respond accurately without needing extensive training phrases.\n\n5. **Sequence Module**: Defines a series of steps in a conversation, allowing for more structured interactions.\n\nThe framework emphasizes clarity and structure, making it easier to develop chatbots that can handle a variety of tasks and provide accurate responses.
