This could be answering FAQs, taking orders, or providing information.\n\n2. **Create the YAML Files**: You'll need to create YAML files that define the modules of your chatbot. Each module can be a menu, action, data gathering, question answering, or sequence module.\n\n3. **Structure Your YAML**: Ensure that your YAML files are structured correctly. Each module should have the necessary fields defined according to the Taskyto syntax.\n\n4. **Example YAML Structure**: Here\u2019s a simple example of a top-level menu module to get you started:\n\n```yaml\n# -----> File: top_level.yaml <-----\nmodules:\n- name: top-level\n  kind: menu\n  presentation: |\n    Welcome to the chatbot! How can I assist you today?\n  fallback: I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.
